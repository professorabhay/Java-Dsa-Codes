OOPs -> s is defined as Structure [Real Life Structure], System [Organizing] !

Hierarchy - 

Object -> Class -> Interface -> [Package] 

Pillars - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Object -> Physical Entity
Class  -> Logical Entity

class Myclass {
	
}

Encapsulation -> Wrapping data in single unit for securing.

Abstraction -> Hiding Irrelevant information which is not needed to someone. 

Inheritance -> Parent class -> Child  class [which also have properties same as parent]
